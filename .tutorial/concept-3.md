# Concept 3: Void Elements 

In your existing project, let's add a few new elements `img`, `hr` & `input`
---

## Update your project
- [ ] Add a `section` tag with a nested `img` tag
- [ ] add the `img` `src` attribute that points to the Launchpad logo found on the [LaunchpadPhilly.org](https://launchpadphilly.org/) website and the `alt` tag text of lp-logo-small.
- [ ] Add a comment "Add a new program to the table"
- [ ] Add 3 labels & input fields with titles and labels `Program`, `Potential Earning` & `Duration` inside the `section` tag
- [ ] The logo and Program label are on the same line. Add a `br` tag to break the line.
- [ ] Add a button to the bottom with the text "Add New Program" 
- [ ] Add a `footer` element to the page and add the text "Launchpad Philly. All Rights Reserved 2024."
- [ ] Add the syntax for the `Copy Right symbol` at the begining of the text "Launchpad Philly. All Rights Reserved 2024.""
- [ ] Add an `hr` tag above the `footer` tag
